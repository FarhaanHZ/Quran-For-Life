<code>Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that he heard the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) say: ''There were three (men) from the Children of Israel: a leper,
a bald-headed, and a blind. Allah wanted to test them, so He sent to them an angel. The angel went to the leper and said:
'Which thing do you like most?' He said: 'A good color, fine skin, and to get rid of what makes me disgusting in the eyes of people.' 
He wiped over his body, so his illness went away and he was given a good color and fine skin. He (the angel) said: 
'Which wealth do you like most?' He said: 'Camels, or cows (the sub-narrator Is'hƒÅq was in doubt).' 
So he was given a she-camel in an advanced stage of pregnancy, and he (the angel) said: 'May Allah bless it for you.' 
Then he went to the bald-headed man and said: 'Which thing do you like most?' He said: 'Good hair, and to get rid of what makes me disgusting
in the eyes of people.' He wiped over his head, so his condition went away and he was given good hair. Then the angel said: 
'Which wealth do you like most?' He said: 'Cows or camels.' So, he was given a pregnant cow and the angel said: 'May Allah bless it for you.
Then he went to the blind man and said: 'Which thing do you like most?' He said: 'That Allah restores to me my eyesight so that I can see people.' 
He wiped over his eyes, so Allah restored to him his eyesight. Then the angel said: 'Which wealth do you like most?' 
He said: 'Sheep.' So he was given a pregnant ewe. The three then had offspring from the ones given to them: one had a valley of camels, 
the second a valley of cows, and the third a valley of sheep. Later, the angel went to the leper in his (past) appearance and said: 
'I am a poor person, and I am running out of provision in my journey, so I cannot reach my destination except with the help of Allah 
and then your favor. I ask you by the One Who gave you good color, fine skin and wealth to give me one camel to carry me in my journey.' 
He said: 'I have many rights to fulfill.' Thereupon, he (the angel) said: 'It seems to me that I know you. 
Were you not a leper whom people found disgusting, and a poor man then Allah gave you wealth?' He said: '
I have inherited this wealth from my forefathers.' Thereupon, the angel said: 'If you are lying, may Allah change you to your past condition.' 
He then went in his (past) appearance to the bald-headed man and said to him the same as what he had said to the leper, and he replied to him in the 
same way the leper did. So, the angel said: 'If you are lying, may Allah change you to your past condition.' Then he went in his (past)
appearance to the blind man and said: 'I am a poor man and a wayfarer. My provisions have run short in my journey, and today there is no way 
to reach my destination except with the help of Allah and then with your help. So, I ask you by the One Who restored to you your eyesight to 
give me one sheep by which I should be able to make provisions for the journey.' The man said: 'I was blind and Allah restored to me my 
eyesight. You may take whatever you like and leave whatever you like. By Allah, I shall not stand in your way today for what you take in the 
name of Allah.' Thereupon, the angel said: 'Keep your property. The fact is that the three of you were put to test. Now, Allah is pleased 
with you and is displeased with your two companions.'"

<code>There was once an unbeatable wrestler in the town of bhagdad, his name was Junaid. Many people challenged him for money, 
but no one could beat him. He was known throughout the village for his strenght and was watched by the crowd and the king.
One day an old man challenged Junaid for a wrestling match. The crowd started laughing, and the king said "Even wind is enough to blow you" He told the king "I know many tricks, and I can defeat him".
When the match had started, Junaid swung his right hand but the old man dodged it, he swung his left hand and again the old man dodged it.
Then the old man jumped and held Junaid, and said "I know i cannot defeat you, I am a follower of Muhammad (SAW) and my family is poor,
if you let me win this match, I can get lots of money, and can feed my family." After junaid hear this, he started acting dizzy and fell down.
The old man jumps over Junaid, and the referee ends the match and the old man wins. Everyone in the crown start yelling "This was such an easy match,
how could Junaid lose" another said "Was he careless" another one said "Was he not playing properly". After the match ended and everyone left the wrestling place,
they started to congratulate the old man, and Junaid on the other hand lost his respect and his honour. When he was sleeping prophet Muhammad(SAW) came to his dreams and told him,
"You lost your respect and your honour, just for that old man. Though u have lost many things now, you are in the friends list of Allah".
Junaid was happy. Though he wasn't a wrestler he became a friend of Allah and a scholar and earned his respect back.
